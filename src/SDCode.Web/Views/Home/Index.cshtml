        <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in our study.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>In this experiment, we are looking at memory for objects within scenes.</p>
        <p>There are four (4) parts to this experiment:  a study phase and three (3) testing phases.  
        In the study phase, you will see a series of images.  In the test phases,
        you will be asked to indicate whether the image being shown is old or new.</p>
        <p>At the study and initial test session, you will be asked to complete basic demographic questions 
            as well as questionnaires pertaining to your sleep habits. Following the questionnaires, you will
            be asked to view a series of images.  Memory for the images will be tested immediately following 
            the study phase and you will be asked to indicate whether the images presented in the test are old 
            or new.  This session should last no longer than an hour and half (1.5 hours).  24-hours after the 
            study/initial test session, you will be asked to complete another memory test.  This will follow the 
            same procedure as the initial test.  Again, you will be shown a set of images and asked to indicate 
            whether they are old or new.  You will receive a reminder the day before this session is scheduled 
            to take place.  The final test will follow the same procedure as the previous two tests.  You will 
            be shown images and asked to indicate whether they are old or new.  You will receive a reminder email 
            the day before the session.</p>
        <p>Please note, this study requires participation across MULTIPLE days (today's session, one session tomorrow, 
        and one final session 1-week from today).  Each session should last roughly one (1) hour. 
        Please only agree to take part if you are prepared to fully commit to all of the 
        experimental sessions.</p>
