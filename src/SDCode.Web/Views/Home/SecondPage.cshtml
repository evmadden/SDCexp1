    <br/>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in our study.<br/>
    <br/>
    In this experiment, we are looking at memory for objects within scenes.  
    <br/>
    There are four (4) parts to this experiment:  a study phase and three (3) testing phases.  
    In the study phase, you will see a series of images.  In the test phases,
    you will be asked to indicate whether the image being shown is old or new.<br/>
    <br/>
    Please note, this study requires participation across MULTIPLE days (today's session, one session tomorrow, 
    and one final session 1-week from today).  Each session should last roughly one (1) hour. 
    Please only agree to take part if you are prepared to fully commit to all of the 
    experimental sessions.<br/>
