    <h1 class="display-4">Informed Consent Information</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>Before agreeing to take part, please read this information sheet carefully 
        and let us know if anything is unclear or you would like further information.</p>
    <p>The study is designed to examine the effects of viewing images on learning and memory. 
        The study consists of a study and initial test phase, a 24-hour delayed testing phase, 
        and a 1-week delayed follow-up testing phase.  At the study and initial test session, you 
        will be asked to complete basic demographic questions as well as questionnaires pertaining 
        to your sleep habits. Following the questionnaires, you will be asked to view a series of images.  
        Memory for the images will be tested immediately following the study phase and you will be asked 
        to indicate whether the images presented in the test are old or new.  This session should last 
        no longer than an hour and half (1.5 hours).  24-hours after the study/initial test session, you 
        will be asked to complete another memory test.  This will follow the same procedure as the initial 
        test.  Again, you will be shown a set of images and asked to indicate whether they are old or new.  
        This is the final session and will be completed one week after the initial study and test phases.  
        You will receive a reminder the day before this session is scheduled to take place.  The final test 
        will follow the same procedure as the previous two tests.  You will be shown images and asked to 
        indicate whether they are old or new.</p>
