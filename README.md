## Safe

Normally administered in a controlled lab environment, the study demands stringent experimental controls, even as pandemic conditions force participants to their homes. The software carefully controls the user experience to best replicate the in-lab experience.

## Simple

A controlled activity flow is enforced, making participation easy, and performance data is automatically captured throughout each phase. The researcher may use the software to access comprehensive experiment data conveniently, and at any time.

## Secure

The software's data processing and storage complies with applicable data protection laws. A "Learn More" page is provided for participants wanting additional information about how data is handled. Authentication is required when researchers access data.

## Free and Open-Source

The software is built and hosted by entirely free tools, including: Visual Studio Code, ASP<span>.</span>NET Core, Bootstrap, SQLite, GitHub, SendGrid, and Azure. It includes configurations for each of development, testing, and production.

### Prerequisites
